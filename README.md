# THAMM: Stream-Native Matchmaking Middleware

**THAMM** is a real-time matchmaking middleware system built on Apache Kafka and Flink. It allows pluggable matchmaking strategies to be applied to incoming player streams with minimal infrastructure setup.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Stream-based matchmaking using Apache Flink
- Pluggable matchmaking strategies (e.g., pair by MMR)
- Kafka-based player input and match output pipelines
- Minimal deployment with Docker Compose
- Ready for metrics, fault tolerance, and scaling (coming next)

---

## 🛠️ Requirements

- [Java 17+](https://adoptium.net/)
- [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

```bash

├── src/                 # Flink job source code
├── strategies/          # Pluggable strategy implementations
├── types/               # Player and Match types
├── docker/              # Kafka, Zookeeper, Flink setup

## ⚙️ Step-by-Step Setup

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/thamm
cd thamm
```

### 2. Start the infrastructure stack

```bash
cd docker
docker-compose up -d
```

This launches:
- Kafka on localhost:9092
- ZooKeeper on localhost:2181
- Flink JobManager UI at localhost:8081

📌 Wait a few seconds for all services to fully start.

---

### 3. Build the project with Maven

```bash
cd ..
mvn clean package
```

This will create target/thamm-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar.

---

### 4. Run the THAMM Flink job (local mode)

```bash
java -jar target/thamm-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar --kafka localhost:9092
```

This will:
- Listen to player join events on Kafka topic player-events
- Apply the matchmaking strategy
- Output matches the Kafka topic match-events

---

### 👥 Simulate Player Input (Coming Next)

In development: a simple Kafka producer will push fake players into player-events.

For now, you can use the Kafka CLI or a Python script to send sample events.

---

## 🧪 Test Your Setup

To see results, try:
```bash
docker exec -it docker-kafka-1 \
  kafka-console-consumer --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 \
  --topic match-events --from-beginning
```

- Task status
- Job graph
- Event throughput

---

## ✅ Next Goals
- Add stateful buffering and window-based control
- Enable checkpointing and fault tolerance
- Create multiple strategy modules
- Add Grafana + Prometheus integration for metrics
- Stress test with high player input volume
